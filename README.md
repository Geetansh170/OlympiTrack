# A Deep Dive into Historical Olympic Performance Trends

This project aims to analyze the historical trends of Olympic performances, focusing on medal tallies, country-wise achievements, sport-wise achievements, and participation in various sports. By examining these patterns, we can discover insights such as the performance of certain countries in specific sports, shifts in performance over time, and variations in participation based on factors like gender and athlete age, etc. The goal is to identify and explore significant trends of the Olympics over the years.
In addition, we might take this analysis a step further by predicting the 2024 Olympic medal tally, with a plan to compare these predictions against the actual results (data strategy yet to be defined).
