# A Deep Dive into Historical Olympic Performance Trends

This project aims to analyze the historical trends of Olympic performances, focusing on medal tallies, country-wise achievements, sport-wise achievements, and participation in various sports. By examining these patterns, we can discover insights such as the performance of certain countries in specific sports, shifts in performance over time, and variations in participation based on factors like gender and athlete age, etc. The goal is to identify and explore significant trends of the Olympics over the years.
In addition, we might take this analysis a step further by predicting the 2024 Olympic medal tally, with a plan to compare these predictions against the actual results (data strategy yet to be defined).

Questions Geetansh

First Question:- 

What is the general trend in women participation country wise over the years? What countries are doing well and how do they compare to the best performing countries?

This general question can lead to multiple hypotheses including the need of promoting women empowerment, understanding and highlighting gender disparity, urgent need to change in policies and awareness, etc.

This is a significant question because in this day and age we should ideally have equal women participation in sports, especially in a major competition like the Olympics. This also helps us identify which countries need to focus on the gender disparity issue more.

Second Question :- 

Are there any sports which are on the decline and losing popularity among participants? Also, are there some sports which have gained popularity over the recent years?

This general question can again lead to multiple hypotheses including the need to spread awareness about some particular sports, predict which sport to remove from the Olympics, what sports have previously suffered this fate, etc.

This is a significant question because we should be aware of which sports are losing popularity to save them from getting extinct. On the world stage we should be able to identify which sports are on the rise, it can be beneficial for marketing and branding (great opportunity for money making). 


Questions Sataakshi

Question 1
How do the trends in medal counts for team sports compare to those for individual sports across different countries over the years, and what insights can be drawn from these comparisons regarding each country's performance in the Olympic Games?

What?
This analysis compares the trends in medal counts for team sports versus individual sports across different countries over the years. Using queries to extract data I have analysed how the number of medals have been won in team events vs in individual events for different countries. This study provides an analysis of how countries perform in team versus individual competitions.
Why?

The question of how trends in medal counts for team sports compare to those for individual sports across different countries is significant for several reasons. It enhances our understanding of national strengths, allowing us to identify which countries excel in team versus individual sports and informing national sports policies. This analysis can also guide investment in sports programs. So, this question provides valuable insights that can shape the future of sports.

Question 2
How has the participation of women athletes in various sports evolved, and what trends can be observed in terms of minimum and maximum participation levels across selected sports?

What?
The analysis of women's participation in various sports over time reveals significant trends in their involvement. By filtering the data for women athletes, we observe how participation levels have increased in these years in all sports. 

Why?

The analysis aims to highlight advancements in women's participation in sports, demonstrating progress in inclusion and representation. By examining trends over time, we can assess the effectiveness of initiatives aimed at increasing female participation and identify sports where participation still lags. This information informs sports organizations and advocates about the current situation of women’s sports. This will help in gender equity in olympics.

Questions Rudraksh

Is the average age of athletes increasing or not? 

As advancements in technologies and therapies improve and preserve Athletes’ health, is it getting reflected through average age or not? 

Also, is the male athlete's average age more than the female athlete or not?
Male athletes tend to have longer careers than female athletes. That’s what we want to investigate as well.

We are showing min, max, and average values of age to do all our analysis.

We are seeing what sports have the shortest and longest career. 

This, in general, can help people to decide which sports to select as a career if they are interested in being an Olympian and playing for the longest time in a sport.

We are showing an average of (max-min) values of age to do all our analysis.
